===========================
A (WIP) set of notes on git
===========================

About
=====

This is meant to be an attempt at a lengthy ``git`` 'cheat sheet'. I
am am still very new to ``git`` and trying to take notes on my
personal progress with ``git``.

There are two set of notes:

- ``git-cheat-sheet.*`` is a rather long cheat sheet in English
- ``git-mini-cheat-sheet.*`` is a 2-page essence of the longer version
  I prepared for my colleagues. It is written in German.

The cheat sheet is work-in-progress and the information given may or may not
be correct. Always double check all information given. I am not responsible
for any data lass due to false information given in the cheat sheet.

Create a PDF file
=================

reStructuredText can be converted to PDF in many ways. I use
``rst2pdf``::

  rst2pdf -s twocolumn -s freetype-serif -s a4-landscape git-cheat-sheet.rst

As an alternative, I use https://github.com/aeberspaecher/rstpdf.
