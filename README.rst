A (WIP) git cheat sheet
=======================

About
=====

This is meant to be an attempt at a ``git`` 'cheat sheet'. I am am still
very new to ``git`` and trying to take notes on my personal progress with
``git``.

There are two cheat sheets:

- ``git-cheat-sheet.*`` is a rather long cheat sheet in English
- ``git-mini-cheat-sheet.*`` is a 2-page essence of the longer version
  I prepared for my colleagues. It is written in German.

The cheat sheet is work-in-progress and the information given may or may not
be correct. Always double check all information given. I am not responsible
for any data lass due to false information given in the cheat sheet.

reStructuredText can be converted to PDF in many ways. I use ``rst2pdf``::
